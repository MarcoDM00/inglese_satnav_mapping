        One of the best services offered is Street View, which enables people to travel through 3D views of many places of the world.
        The basemap data is created differently based on one’s country: in some countries Google Maps licenses maps from third parties while in other countries it uses its own map data (created by cars trawling the roads with GPS, tracing over satellite imagery, and user corrections).
        Updates to the map may vary: sometimes twice a month, sometimes every couple of years.
        Users can submit changes via the web interface.`

        the major problem with this satnav mapping is that it creates more detailed areas than others where such people aren’t active.`
